## XiaoMount - TurtleWoW Edition

XiaoMount is an auto-equipper for riding speed gear that will detect the best available riding equipment and equip it when you are mounted.
When you dismount it will restore your original gear setup. It works out of the box without any configuration necessary. It has been made for TurtleWoW specific riding equipment.
Auto swim speed equipping is planned for the future
